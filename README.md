This automation project was developed as part of an assignment. 
The project is implemented in Java using Selenium, JUnit, and Cucumber to automate and validate various user interactions with a web application. 

Key Features and Scenarios:
Button Click Validation: Automated the process of clicking a specific button on the web application (https://demoqa.com/) and verifying that the correct outcome occurs as a result of the action.

Dropdown Selection Validation: Developed a test scenario to select a specific term from a dropdown list and verify that the term has been correctly selected. This ensures that the dropdown functionality behaves as expected.

File Upload Automation: Automated the file upload process by selecting a file stored within the project structure and uploading it through the web application. The test verifies that the file is successfully uploaded.

Date Picker Selection (Optional): An optional scenario was implemented where the date picker functionality was tested. The automation script selects a new date from the date picker and verifies that the selected date is accurately reflected in the application.

Tools and Technologies:

Java: The core programming language used for writing the automation scripts. 

Selenium: Used to interact with the web elements and perform automated actions such as clicks, selections, and file uploads.

JUnit: Integrated for managing test cases and asserting the expected outcomes.

Cucumber: Employed to write test cases in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style, making the test scripts easy to understand and maintain.
